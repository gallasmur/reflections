How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because it detects the differences between the two files and show it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can be more efficient because I can return to previous versions of my files easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
You have to remember when to commit but does commit are so much meaningful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like
Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I do not have any idea.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log you can see the history of commits with descriptions and then compare two different versions with git
diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It makes you more confident because you do not have to worry if the changes do not work, you will always have the
posibility of reverting those changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
With all my projects.
