When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your project with the public and when you are working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
Because you will only push changes when they are ready to be made public.
